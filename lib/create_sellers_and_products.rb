          For 15 years, dynamic web content has been written in a single language: 
          JavaScript. Now, for the first time, programmers have an alternative that doesn't
           add an extra layer of abstraction or require plugins. CoffeeScript provides all
            of JavaScript's functionality wrapped in a cleaner, more succinct syntax that 
            encourages use of "the good parts" of the language.
